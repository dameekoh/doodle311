* URL of the git repository with the source code. This can be on gitea or a public repository in Github, or equivalent.
* URL of your video on YouTube. This should be a public or unlisted video (not private!) on YouTube (no other platforms)
* A description of the game - how it works and what the user has to do

The game is a platformer where the player controls a ball and tries to jump on platforms to reach higher levels. 

Goal: to keep climbing as high as possible without falling off the screen or touching a black hole. The player can perform regular jumps and interact with different types of platforms that provide various effects, such as fragile platforms that break upon landing and spring platforms that give an extra boost. The game continues until the player falls off the screen or touches a black hole, at which point they can restart the game by pressing the space bar.

* A description of the organization of your code. Feel free to use diagrams, UML, or others. What are the main functions/classes? If you used patterns, what did you use them for, and how do different parts of your code speak to each other?
* Highlight any issue you want us to know about or whether the code has any known bug. If there are special features you want us to know about, write them here
* Acknowledge any help or resource you used
* Writing style might be considered in grading (not the grammar, but rather the clarity of your writing)
Be visual
* Try to be complete in your explanation - you do not need to write a lot, but the professor and the TA should be able to understand your documentation and your code by reading this file.*
